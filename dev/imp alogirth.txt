ndim=16
Algorithm to decompose a higher dimension Ket Vector into Individual basis vectors(of dim 2x1)

1). Get the Dimension of the Ket Vector(column matrix) and store in ndim
2). Initiate the iteration with  2
3). Divide ndim of input Ket Vector(column matrix) with 2 and obtain quotient say q
4). now compute nearest kronecker product of Ket Vector with q and 2 in format (q, 2) pair and store value in result
4). if result is None, the change format to (2, q) 
5). If result again is None in Step 5, possibly the state vector is entanlged. Move to Step 6
6). 

>>q is: 8
